# Lab Report 2

## _Notes_

###	Why use Git



* Helps with multiple users working on the same file
* Tracks changes made by users
* Can revert to previous versions

###	Linking an SSH key to your GitHub



* Github does not accept passwords for authenticating git operations
* Need an Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) to link your computer to your account

	

###	Git Basics



* Checks current working tree status locally
    * git status
* Fetches update from remote
    * git pull
* Stage all files “-A” for all
    * git add -A
    * git commit -m “&lt;your message>”
* Update remote
    * git push

### Gitignore



* Make sure ‘.gitignore’ is in the root directory
* Git cannot track binary files, so use gitignore
* Files such as PDF, JPG PNG could be ignored

### Best Practices



* ‘Test first, commit second’
* Don't commit work that hasn't been finished
* Write concise commit messages
* Commit small things frequently over significant things rarely
* Have consistent conventions for the project, such as formatting and naming
